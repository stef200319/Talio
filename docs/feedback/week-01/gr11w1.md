## Formative feedback for group 11 - Week 1



#### 1) Self-organization

Good: The team leader conducted the discussion very well, but the speaking distribution was unequal. The entire discussion was very respectful and polite, but in the next meetings students should try to offer their input equally.

#### 2) Suggested Topics

Very good: All of the suggested topics were covered, and the group members moderated the conversation. In the next meetings, it would be useful if the chair is more mindful of the time limits.

### General suggestions:
- Read the Teamwork files;
- Make sure the speaking distribution is approximately equal;
- Be mindful of the time limit;
- Prioritise items. If something has low priority and can be solved after the meeting, move on to the next point.
