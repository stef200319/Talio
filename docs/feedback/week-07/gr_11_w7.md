# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization


Chair: Davide Tudose

Minute taker: Thijs van der Valk


Mark: Pass

#### Agenda 

Mark: Good


Feedback:
- The agenda was added to the repo in time and follows the official template. 
- The points were clearly described, but the order was a bit impractical (after each member's contribution, it would be better to present the demo instead of changing the subject and going over the feedback for a not code-related assignment.)
