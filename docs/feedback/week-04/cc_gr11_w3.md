# Code Contributions and Code Reviews

#### Focused Commits


Grade: Insufficient


Feedback: There are no functional commits yet. When you start implementing features, make sure that commits only affect a small number of files and aggregate a concrete, coherent change to the system which is summarised in a descriptive and short title, phrased as explained in the course (present tense verbs).

#### Isolation

Grade: Insufficient


Feedback: There are no integrated merge requests. When you start implementing features, make sure they are isolated (each one is developed in its own branch). 


#### Reviewability

Grade: Insufficient


Feedback: There are no MR related to functionality. When you start implementing, make sure that Merge Requests are easy to review. To achieve this:

- use the title and description to clarify the purpose of the MR, as well as important aspects to consider, why you made certain decisions, etc.
- avoid too many commits or too many affected files
- keep changes coherent and related to each other
- merge often, so that each branch does not have too much of a deviation from main.



#### Code Reviews

Grade: Insufficient


Feedback: There are no meaningful code reviews on the repository yet. For future merge requests, please make sure:
- not to leave them open for too long;
- to avoid approving MR's without reviewing;
- to keep discussions constructive, goal oriented and respectful.
